                        (Light Weight Fighter) program, the other option was the Yf-17 which would later have massive changes and beomce the Navy's F-18.
                        During a highspeed test on a runway the test pilot wasn't used to the new joystick on the F-16 so to save the plane from crashing took off. 
                        This making the F-16's first flight on January 20th 1974. Although this the F-16 wasn't put into operational service until October 1st 1980.

                    <p class="storiesPara">Phil Oestricher was completing a high speed taxi test where they were supposed to accelerate up to 240km/h on the runway and then stop.
                            This was to test the prototype airframe but whilst accelerating Phil was unable to get the plane under control causing the plane to start veering off the runway on its side.
                            In a snap decision Phil lifted up the nose and took off for its first accidental flight on January 20 1974. This unexpected flight happened due to the new features on the aircraft that the test pilot wasn’t used and lucky got it back to safety after a six minute flight.

                    <p class="storiesPara">On January 19, 1991, during the start of Operation Desert Storm, F‑16 pilot Major Emmett “Stroke 3” Tullia flew over heavily defended Baghdad to strike an oil refinery. 
                        After hitting the target, he was met with a barrage of six Iraqi surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). 
                        Despite his flares and chaff failing to deploy, Tullia used intense high‑G maneuvers, sharp turns, barrel rolls, dives to dodge each one. 
                        At one point he even heard a missile’s motor roaring as it zipped by. For around seven stressful minutes he wriggled through the missile onslaught purely through flying skill, not countermeasures, and managed to return safely, earning him the Distinguished Flying Cross.

                        The first prototype flew on July 27, 1972 at Edwards AFB. The trainer variant flew in July 1973.
                        The first F‑15B was delivered in November 1974, and the aircraft entered operational service in September 1975 (combat squadron deliveries began January 1976).
                        The F-15 has the highest air to air kill ratio at 104-0.

                    <p class="storiesPara">During a training exercise in Israel in 1983 a F-15 collided with an A-4 skyhawk causing a wing of the F-15 to come off. 
                        The pilot decided to accelerate to get enough lift to take control and head back to base. 
                        Israel pilot Zivi Nedivi was able to land on the runway under emergence conditions with its tail hook at twice the speed an F-15 would normally land. 
                        The F-15 came to a stop slightly off the runway and after getting out the plane the pilot realised the severity of the damage and admitted if he’d know he would’ve just ejected. 
                        He couldn’t see the damage because of the fuel flying up from where the wing used to be.

                        Although the success of destroying the test satellite; that was already broken. 
                        The program was shut down due to it being the height of the cold war and was infringing on the USA and USSR treaty for no weapons in space. 
                        This was a feat on modern day aerospace engineering to get it to work by pushing both the missile and F-15 to their limit to be able to complete this.

                        The F‑22 Raptor is a U.S. Air Force fifth‑generation stealth air superiority fighter developed by Lockheed Martin in partnership with Boeing and powered by Pratt & Whitney engines. 
                        It traces its roots to the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition of the 1980s, which pitted the YF‑22 against the YF‑23. Although the YF‑23 was stealthier and faster, the YF‑22 was more maneuverable, flown more extensively in testing, and came in at lower risk and cost—ultimately winning the contract on April 23, 1991. 
                        Despite flying in 1997, the F‑22 wasn’t declared operational until December 15, 2005. 
                        Deliveries began in late 2002, and the last of 195 aircraft rolled out in May 2012.

                <div class="storiesBox">   
                    <p class="storiesPara">On September 17, 2013 near Iran during a surveillance and reconnaissance mission a MQ-1`reaper was flying around when 2 Iranian F4’s were scrambled to go take it down. 
                        The US realised this and sent an F-22 to stop them from destroying the predator drone using any means possible. 
                        The F-22 is a stealthy plane and was able to fly right up belong side the 2 F4’s without being spotted. 
                        Instead of shooting both pilots down the F-22 gained altitude and got between the F4’s so they could see him. 
                        The pilot got on the radio and said “You really oughta go home.” and scared off both of the Iranian pilots without firing.

                        The F/A‑18E/F Super Hornet is an American carrier‑based multirole fighter built by McDonnell Douglas. 
                        It traces its lineage to the Northrop YF‑17 “Cobra” a competitor in the Air Force’s Lightweight Fighter program which, after losing to the YF‑16, was scaled up into the original F/A‑18 Hornet for the Navy. 
                        The Super Hornet made its maiden flight on November 29, 1995, and entered operational service with the U.S. Navy in 1999. Although it only replaced the Grumman F‑14 Tomcat which retired fully in 2006, the Super Hornet has gone on to become the backbone of U.S carrier aviation and remains in service and combat operations into the 2020s. This fighter jet will be one of the most well known and iconic aircraft due to Top Gun: Maverick.

                <div class="storiesBox">   
                    <p class="storiesPara">In 2024 an unnamed female pilot launching from the USS Dwight D. 
                        Eisenhower became the first American women to ever shoot down an air to air target in real combat. 
                        This was done by shooting down a one way attack drone launched by Yemen in her F/A-18 Super Hornet. 
                        This marks a significant step for female aviationists in the US military. 
                        Women had done plenty of missions in air to ground and other areas but the first air to air kill is significant towards the future of women in the air force.

                        The US has been battling the Houthis since December 2023 over them attacking ships entering in the Suez canal. 
                        Throughout 2024 and 2025 the US have been using F/A-18 Super Hornets to destroy Houthi capabilities to attack ships in the sea. 
                        They have done this using many conventional munitions and Tomahawk cruise missiles. 
                        The main targets have been radar sites, drone and missile launch zones, and air defense around Yemen where the Houthi’s are situated.
