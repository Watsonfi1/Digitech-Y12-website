                        The Sukhoi Su‑27 Flanker is a Soviet/Russian twin‑engine air-superiority fighter developed by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. 
                        It began life in the late 1960s–early 1970s in direct response to the U.S. 
                        F‑15 Eagle. Similar to the F-16 during high-speed test flights, Soviet pilots encountered control-system quirks. 
                        One particularly test ended with a pilot pulling hard on pitch controls at high speed and unexpectedly forcing the Su‑27 into an early airborne recovery effectively turning an runway overrun into a take‑off maneuver. 
                        That unplanned lift‑off gave the Su‑27 its maiden flight on 20 May 1977. Although it entered service in the mid‑1980s, full-scale production ramped up only in the late Cold War.

                    <p class="storiesPara">
                        Tragically during an airshow in Ukraine on the 27th of July 2002 an Su-27 operated by the Ukrainian airforce crashed into a crowd of people killing 77 spectators and injuring over 500 others. 
                        This was due to pilot error and rushed flight planning that put the crowd in an unsafe place. 
                        This is the deadliest airshow ever and although so many died the pilots both safely ejected with no injuries. 
                        This shows fighter jets are powerful and safe but they can become extremely dangerous without precaution.

                        During 1989 Paris Air Show an Su-27 and pilot Viktor Pugachev decided to show off to the audience with a cobra maneuver. 
                        The cobra maneuver is the most famous move where a pilot put a plane into a 90 degree turn without gaining height or losing it. 
                        It’s a difficult move that doesn’t have any advantage in a fight but looks cool in a airshow. 
                        This move has been seen and done in capable aircraft across the world since including Top Gun: Maverick and other shows.

                        The MiG‑21 “Fishbed” is a Soviet second‑generation supersonic fighter‑interceptor developed by the Mikoyan‑Gurevich Design Bureau. 
                        It emerged from a mid‑1950s Soviet requirement for a lightweight interceptor to replace the MiG‑17 and MiG‑19. 
                        The first flight occurred on February 14, 1955, putting it among the earliest Soviet aircraft to break Mach 2. 
                        It entered operational service in 1959, serving as the backbone of the Soviet Air Forces and being widely exported to over 50 countries the MiG‑21 became the most‑produced supersonic jet ever, with more than 11,000 built, and it remains in service in some countries even today.

                    <p class="storiesPara">
                        The Vietcong (National Liberation Front) used mig 21’s supplied by Russia to great effect during the Vietnam war supposedly. 
                        It’s hard to verify the actual amount of fighter jets shot down during the Vietnam war on either side but by most statistics the North Vietnamese shot down over 100 american F4’s and lost around 60 mig 21’s during Operation Rolling Thunder. 
                        The Mig 21’s were very successful due to the lack of a gun on most F4’s during the time and unreliability of low altitude launches of radar missiles allowing Mig 21’s to fly low and fast and then dogfight with their guns and IR (Infrared) missiles. 
                        Many Vietnamese fighters got aces due to these tactics relying heavily on each pilots capability in dogfights allowing the good fighters to rack up many kills. 
                        On the other side only one US pilot got an ace during the Vietnam war against the Soviet Mig 21’s. 
                        This exceptional performance of the fighters started to get worse at the end of the war with F4’s more commonly having weapon pods attached to be able to shoot back. 
                        Vietnam is the most famous use cases of the Mig 21 in combat and got lots of other countries to buy export models of the fighter.

                        The Su‑57 Felon is a Russian fifth‑generation stealth multirole fighter, developed under the PAK FA programme by Sukhoi.

                        The pilot ejected safely, but the aircraft was destroyed just before it could be handed over to the Russian government. 
                        Although marketed as a competitor to the F-35, F-22, and J-20 it doesn’t actually compare.

                        The first Su-57 that was supposed to enter service in the Russian airforce was called the Blue01 but during testing mere days before it suffered an accident. 
                        When at around 8000m there was a problem with its wiring system causing the jet to spiral uncontrollably and the pilot had to eject at 2000m before the plane crashed into the ground. 
                        This was a big upset as it was meant to be Russia’s latest and greatest and had crashed mere days before entering service.

                        The Ukraine airforce recently have been able to equip their MiG 29’s with the US AGM-88 HARM missiles which are great at destroying air defense systems. 
                        This works through the Ukrainian version of the US Wild Weasels getting locked or tracked by a radar system and using the HARM’s to target the radiation beams that are tracking them. 
                        This allows the missile to know where the air defense and guide itself toward the last know location of these air defenses. 
                        The Ukrainian’s have used this to great effect by destroying a S-400 system which is supposedly one of the best long range air defense systems in the world and the best in Russia along with the S-500. 
                        This capability is significant to destroy radar systems around Russia allowing less maneuverable and survivable planes to not have to worry about ground based systems attacking them.
