                    The Eurofighter Typhoon is a multirole fighter jet developed by a European group comprising the UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain. 
                    Its first flight occurred on March 27, 1994, when the prototype DA1 took off from Manching. Despite its maiden flight in 1994, the Typhoon didn’t enter operational service until 2003. 
                    The first aircraft was delivered to the German Luftwaffe on April 8, 2003. 
                    The Eurofighter Typhoon was made from a collection of countries being Germany, Italy, UK, and Spain with their leading aerospace defense companies all working together to make an european fighter.

            <div class="storiesBox">   
                <p class="storiesPara"> 
                    UK Eurofighter FGR.4’s were used during the Libyan Civil War in 2011 to attack pro-Gaddafi military targets. 
                    NATO had enforced a no fly zone and a blockade around Libya to stop Gaddafi forces from using aircraft and helicopters from killing civilians and to keep weapons coming in to support the regime. 
                    The Eurofighter did over 1,300 missions in Libya consisting of tanks, artillery, radar installations, vehicle and weapon depots. 
                    The Eurofighter had a strong presence in Libya due to their capabilities at using air to ground guided weaponry well to destroy targets. 
                    Although they never shot anything down they are very capable jets that would’ve been able to take out any aircraft that were flying during the no fly zone. 
                    Throughout the 6 month deployment the eurofighter’s maintained a 97% availability which is exceptionally high and allowed the Royal Air Force (RAF) to be able to be prepared for any attacks. 
                    The Eurofighter’s lack of air to air engagements during the Libyan war is due to the Libyan’s being scared that they are outmatched by western fighter jets.

                <h2 class="pagePara">
                    The JAS-39 Gripen is a Swedish made multirole fighter jet that was made to replace the aging Draken and Viggen fighter jets. 
                    The JAS stands for Jakt, attack, spanning (hunting, reconnaissance, and attacking) meaning the JAS is capable at multiple things including air to air and air to ground combat. 
                    The Gripen is the latest fighter jet from the company SAAB who designed the plane specifically for Swedish needs for defense against Russia. 
                    The JAS 39 Gripen is the only fighter jet ever to fly on 100% biofuel that is fully renewable and sustainable without any modifications to the engine. 
                    The engines also suffered no damage or loss in capability, although they demonstrated this once they don’t use it to fly Gripens due to it costing more than 2-3x normal kerosene fuels and the fuel is also less available. 
                    The latest E version of JAS 39 Gripen could be argued to be anywhere within the top 3 jets in Europe. 
                    Also it’s extremely budget friendly over time with a $4,700-8000 per flight hour cost compared to things like the F-35 with ~$33,300 per flight hour. 
                    Other things the Gripen excels at is it’s short runway required to takeoff allowing it to takeoff from highways and makeshift bases, also it’s exceptionally fast 10-20 minute turnaround speed allows quick rearming and reengaging being perfect for defense.

                    During Falcon Strike exercises between Thailand and China the Gripen C and Su-27 were pitted against each other in simulated fights the Gripens beat the Su-27’s 41 times and only lost 9 times in BVR (Beyond Visual Range) combat. 
                    This showed the Grippens dominance in 30km and greater range fights against the Chinese Su-27’s. 
                    In the 50km+ range the Thai pilots were able to beat the Chinese 10-0 with them utterly destroying them. 
                    Although the massive success in BVR combat when the did the WVR (With-in Visual Range) combat the Su-27 beat the Gripen 25-1 within 30km range but this was due to the Su-27 having more powerful engines and the Gripen not being able to use the more modern IRIS-T and having to use the much older Aim-9L. 
                    This could’ve caused the significant change within 30km but without proper information of the simulated engagements it’s hard to tell how it would’ve changed it.

                    The Dassault Rafale is the most modern French fighter jet. 
                    It’s a multirole aircraft made for normal and naval operations which is good for France since it doesn’t need to make another for the Charles De Gaulle carrier. 
                    The Dassault Rafale was created after France pulled out of the Future European Fighter Aircraft project (Later would become the Eurofighter) due to different wants from France. 
                    An early Rafale prototype flew in 1986 but the Rafale C prototype that would later become the Rafale didn’t fly until 1991. 
                    When the Cold War ended budget cuts to the military across Europe occurred leading to France’s naval fighter Rafale M entering service in 2004, and 2006 for the Rafale C and B for the French airforce.

                    The Rafale has had multiple combat operations throughout its time in military service with most of it happening during the war on terror. 
                    France secured the no fly zone in Libya in 2011 although it didn’t get any to air to air kills and mostly struck ground based radar arrays. 
                    The Rafale has also been used in Mali in 2013 with four Rafale’s attacking jihadist terrorist positions damaging their capabilities to operate without any damage to themselves. 
                    This was only one of Frances many bombings during its air campaign in the region. 
                    France’s Rafales have joined with US forces to strike ISIS targets throughout 2014 and 2015 but tragically because of these attacks ISIS tried to get revenge with their terror attacks in Paris on the 13 November 2015 which killed 137 and injured plenty more. 
                    The Rafale has been recently in the news because one or more apparently got shot down by Pakistani J-10C’s during India’s preemptive strikes on Pakistan's bases throughout the country to cripple their capability to respond.
