                        The Chengdu J‑20 Mighty Dragon is a Chinese fifth gen stealth multirole fighter built by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Corporation. 
                        Although the plane first flew in 2011 the jet wasn’t introduced into PLAAF operations until March 2017, with actual combat readiness not being until later in 2018. 
                        The J-20 is the third ever fifth generation fighter jet to enter service after the US made F-22 and F-35. 
                        Like the F-22 the J-20 is able to break the sound barrier without using afterburners which is a feature that few fighter jets are able to accomplish. 
                        An uncommon feature of the J-20 is no internal autocannon not allowing for a gun fight if required. Although missile combat is the most common thing, countries like America are scared to remove it due to what happened in Vietnam when they originally did and they’re still useful for things such as air to ground and other capabilities.

                        The Chinese released photos of the J-20 in 2011 in a way that made them seem like a leak to show China entering the modern age of fighter jets and show the Chinese people they’re powerful. 
                        This leak was done purposefully to try and gain attention from the people without having to announce if it was ready or not yet. 
                        Although not too long after the Chinese showed off their first public flight of the J-20 in front of the US Defense Secretary when they were visiting Beijing to show the US that they’re catching up and no longer are a minor power this flight lasted 15 minutes. 
                        China later used the plane to show off more by showing its maneuverable capabilities with videos of it doing difficult maneuvers requiring thrust vectoring such as Cobra and Falling Leaf maneuvers which are very difficult. 
                        Although a lot of its public image has been to show off and prove they’re as good as the US it’s still thought to be a powerful competitor but has little proof to show it surpasses jets such as the F-22 and F-35.

                        It’s maiden flight was in March 1998 with it going through lots of testing before entering full service close to six years later in December of 2003.

                        Recent usage in Pakistan will gain more popularity for Chinese vehicles in the export market.

                        Recently Pakistani J-10C’s were able to shoot down at least one Indian Rafale fighter jet. 
                        Pakistan claims they destroyed 3 Rafale’s along with other Russian bought fighter jets. 
                        The US says they think they have enough proof that Pakistan shot down 2 fighter jets, 1 being a Rafale. From the limited information on the topic it’s believed that Pakistan used Chinese PL-15E’s along with AWE&C’s to be able to give early warning and guide missiles from within Pakistani territory. 
                        The usage of Pakistan’s AWE&C alongside with India’s lack of secure communication, electronic warfare, and MICA’s with only an 80km range. 
                        India was preemptively striking Pakistan meaning they didn’t have their normal radar advantage and Pakistan had an advantage of being able to stay in their own airspace allowing the J10’s to strike Indian fighters. 
                        This showed that a significantly cheaper fighter jet can beat more expensive jets like the Rafale in advantageous conditions such as defence. 
                        Although due to the lack of information without bias this could be completely or slightly different.

                        The J‑15 is a Chinese naval multirole fighter developed by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation under the Flying Shark program. 
                        It comes from an incomplete Soviet Su‑33 prototype acquired from Ukraine that China used to reverse engineer their J-15. 
                        Shenyang had previously made the J-11B from reverse engineering the Su-27’s they were domestically producing under the name J-11A. This previous experience made them suitable to reverse engineer another fighter jet and make a similar one for the Chinese navy. 
                        The J‑15 program officially began in 2006. Six years later the jet landed aboard China’s first carrier, Liaoning, successfully on November 25, 2012 marking China's first naval fighter arresting cable landing. 
                        Finally in 2013 operational service marking the first Chinese naval fighter. 
                        Later variants made allowed them to takeoff with a catapult and allowed them to work on modern Chinese carriers that didn’t have a ski jump for takeoff.

                <div class="storiesBox">   
                    <p class="storiesPara">
                        During a Japanese P-3C’s surveillance mission just outside of Japanese waters on June 7th a J-15 moved very close towards the P-3C. 
                        The J-15 at one point in the 40 minute chase came within 45 meters of the P-3C which is dangerous due to many reasons such as causing wake in the air messing with each others engines. 
                        Fighter jets are also massive beasts that can be over 20m in length and 15m in width so they’re easily able to collide with a minor mistake. 
                        The J-15 supposedly also flew in front of the P-3C only 900 meters ahead causing wake which could cause errors. 
                        The next day during another Japanese surveillance mission another J-15 followed this time for 80 minutes and also came within 45 meters at time. 
                        The Chinese were using both of their carriers simultaneously and J-15’s where flying throughout the day and claimed these cases were accidents. 
                        The Japanese Defense Ministry claimed these action were dangerous, abnormal, and deliberate. 
                        This is probably due to China trying to project its power and show that it can attack beyond their borders easily.
