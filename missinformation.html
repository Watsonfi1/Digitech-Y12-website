        <p class="storiesPara">Missinformation won't make itself easy to spot all the time. 
            There are some key things that you have to lookout for when gather or learning new information.
            <br> <br>
            <b>1. Who is creating this?</b>
            <br> Is the site or source that you got the information from trustable?
            You should always check where the information coming from e.g. would you trust a Russian propaganda site with US information or vice versa?
            Make sure the source you gather information is from somewhere trustable and not some random Tiktoker. 
            Just always remeber if information seems unbelievable check it at more sources that are trustable, and be skeptical that major sources can sometimes fall to missinformation.
            <br> <br>
            <b>2. Read more than just the Headline</b>
            <br> The headlines are always trying to hook you into reading the article. 
            Websites make money from getting views so you should not just believe their headlines as they will often have a caveat.
            Also if an article is using language that is supposed to get an emotion out of you like anger and fear it could be false.
            Make sure that you check before whole heartedly believing these sources which are just trying to make money.
            <br> <br>
            <b>3. Check if they have evidence supporting their point</b>
            <br> Lots of modern articles are based upon little facts and lots of he says she says. 
            This means lots of the information even if correct is unreliable so you should always check for this. 
            When looking to see if something is including missinformation the main thing to understand is that if their is a reason for this source to misled like profit don't trust it
