    <h1 class="storiesHeader">1. Figuring out if something is classified</h1>
    <h1 class="storiesSubHeader" id="smallTxt">Checking document for Official government marks declaring classification</h1>
    <p class="storiesPara">
        The most prominent place for one of these markings is at the top of the document. 
        Sometimes it will appear at the bottom of the document though so check both.
        These markings will often be obvious with a name like classied, classified within ..., secret, top secret, and confidential.
        If a document looks like it's classified it's best to stay away from it if you don't need it for anything.
        You also have to aware of documents which might be classified in a country meaning you can share and use the contry with people from that country who are in it, but you can't share outside of that country.
        Finally just because information is public knowledge it doesn't mean a source with that information isn't classified.

    <h1 class="storiesHeader">2. Reporting information if it's classified</h1>
    <p class="storiesPara">
        Reporting information and removing it from your access is important so you don't get a massive fine, or prision sentence. 
        If you encounter classified information you must protect the information from getting out by not telling anyone about it or helping in the spreading of the information.
        Spreading this information can lead to massive sentences in prision in your current or foreign countries. 
        If you do stumble across a website with it delete your history and history cache so no information is stored on your computer or the cloud storage your using. 
        Report the information to a department in your government that could later send that information to the correct authorities, or the authorities themselves.
        When sending this information make sure you don't send information to them unencrypted that could cause others to aquire it.
